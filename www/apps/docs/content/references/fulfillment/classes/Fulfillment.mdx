# Fulfillment

A Fulfillment is created once an admin can prepare the purchased goods. Fulfillments will eventually be shipped and hold information about how to track shipments. Fulfillments are created through a fulfillment provider, which typically integrates a third-party shipping service. Fulfillments can be associated with orders, claims, swaps, and returns.
