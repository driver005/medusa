# Sales Channels

Queries and Mutations listed here are used to send requests to the [Admin Sales Channel API Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#sales-channels).

All hooks listed require [user authentication](medusa_react.Hooks.Admin.Auth.mdx#useadminlogin).

A sales channel indicates a channel where products can be sold in. For example, a webshop or a mobile app.
Admins can manage sales channels and the products available in them.

  // ...

  const handleDeleteProducts = (productId: string) => {
    deleteProducts.mutate({
      product_ids: [
        {
          id: productId,

### useAdminAddLocationToSalesChannel

This hook associates a stock location with a sales channel. It requires the 
[@medusajs/stock-location](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/multiwarehouse/install-modules#stock-location-module) module to be installed in
your Medusa backend.

#### Example

```ts
import React from "react"
import { 
  useAdminAddLocationToSalesChannel
} from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  salesChannelId: string
}

const SalesChannel = ({ salesChannelId }: Props) => {
  const addLocation = useAdminAddLocationToSalesChannel()
  // ...

  const handleAddLocation = (locationId: string) => {
    addLocation.mutate({
      sales_channel_id: salesChannelId,
      location_id: locationId
    }, {
      onSuccess: ({ sales_channel }) => {
        console.log(sales_channel.locations)
      }
    })
  }

  // ...
}

export default SalesChannel
```

### useAdminRemoveLocationFromSalesChannel

This hook removes a stock location from a sales channel. This only removes the association between the stock 
location and the sales channel. It does not delete the stock location. This hook requires the 
[@medusajs/stock-location](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/multiwarehouse/install-modules#stock-location-module) module to be installed in
your Medusa backend.

#### Example

```ts
import React from "react"
import { 
  useAdminRemoveLocationFromSalesChannel
} from "medusa-react"

type Props = {
  salesChannelId: string
}

const SalesChannel = ({ salesChannelId }: Props) => {
  const removeLocation = useAdminRemoveLocationFromSalesChannel()
  // ...

  const handleRemoveLocation = (locationId: string) => {
    removeLocation.mutate({
      sales_channel_id: salesChannelId,
      location_id: locationId
    }, {
      onSuccess: ({ sales_channel }) => {
        console.log(sales_channel.locations)
      }
    })
  }

  // ...
}

export default SalesChannel
```

      {sales_channels && sales_channels.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {sales_channels.map((salesChannel) => (
            <li key={salesChannel.id}>{salesChannel.name}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default SalesChannels
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved within the sales channels:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminSalesChannels } from "medusa-react"

const SalesChannels = () => {
  const { 
    sales_channels, 
    isLoading
  } = useAdminSalesChannels({
    expand: "locations"
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {sales_channels && !sales_channels.length && (
        <span>No Sales Channels</span>
      )}
      {sales_channels && sales_channels.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {sales_channels.map((salesChannel) => (
            <li key={salesChannel.id}>{salesChannel.name}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default SalesChannels
```

By default, only the first `20` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `limit` and `offset` properties:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useAdminSalesChannels } from "medusa-react"

const SalesChannels = () => {
  const { 
    sales_channels, 
    limit,
    offset,
    isLoading
  } = useAdminSalesChannels({
    expand: "locations",
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {sales_channels && !sales_channels.length && (
        <span>No Sales Channels</span>
      )}
      {sales_channels && sales_channels.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {sales_channels.map((salesChannel) => (
            <li key={salesChannel.id}>{salesChannel.name}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default SalesChannels
```
