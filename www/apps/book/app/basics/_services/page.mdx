In this chapter, you'll learn what services are and how to create a service.

## What is a Service?

A service is a class that holds methods related to a business logic or commerce functionality. For example, the `ProductService` holds methods to retrieve and manage products.

## How to Create a Service

Services are created in a TypeScript or JavaScript file under the `src/services` directory of your Medusa application.

For example, to create a `HelloWorld` service, create the file `src/services/hello-world.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/services/hello-world.ts"
class HelloWorld {
  // TODO add methods
}

export default HelloWorld
```

<Note title="Tip">

A service's file name must be the kebab-case name of the service without the word `Service`.

</Note>

## When to Use

<Note title="Use services when" type="success">

- You're implementing custom commerce functionality to be reused across the Medusa application.
- You're integrating a third-party service, such as an ERP system.

</Note>

## Resolve Resources

In a service's constructor, you can resolve other services or resources of your Medusa application using the Medusa container.

For example, you can resolve the `IProductModuleService` to use it in your methods:

```ts title="src/services/hello-world.ts" highlights={[["10"]]}
import { IProductModuleService } from "@medusajs/types"

type InjectedDependencies = {
  productModuleService: IProductModuleService
}

class HelloWorldService {
  protected productModuleService: IProductModuleService

  constructor({ productModuleService }: InjectedDependencies) {
    this.productModuleService = productModuleService
  }

  async getMessage(): Promise<string> {
    const [, count] =
      await this.productModuleService.listAndCount()

    return `You have ${count} products`
  }
}

export default HelloWorldService
```
