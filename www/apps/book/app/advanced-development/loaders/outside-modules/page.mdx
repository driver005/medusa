In this chapter, you’ll learn how to create a loader outside a module.

## Loaders in the Medusa Application

In your Medusa application, you can create loaders under the `src/loaders` directory outside a module. The Medusa application runs these loaders on start-up.

This is useful if you’re performing a task on application start-up, but don’t need to define it in a module.

## How to Create a Loader Outside a Module?

To create a loader in your Medusa application outside a module, create a TypeScript or JavaScript file under the `src/loaders` directory that default exports a function.

For example, create the file `src/loaders/hello-world.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/loaders/hello-world.ts"
export default function () {
  console.log(
    "[HELLO LOADER] Just started the Medusa application!"
  )
}
```

This loader logs the message `[HELLO LOADER] Just started the Medusa application!` when the Medusa application starts.

### Test Out the Loader

To test out your loader, start the Medusa application:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

You’ll see in the terminal the logged message, indicating that the loader function was executed successfully.

## Resolve Resources

When the loader function is created outside a module, it receives the Medusa container as a parameter. Use it to resolve other resources in your application, such as a module’s service.

For example:

```ts title="src/loaders/hello-world.ts"
import { MedusaContainer } from "@medusajs/medusa"
import { IProductModuleService } from "@medusajs/types"
import { ModuleRegistrationName } from "@medusajs/modules-sdk"

export default async function (container: MedusaContainer) {
  const productModuleService: IProductModuleService =
    container.resolve(ModuleRegistrationName.PRODUCT)

  const [, count] = await productModuleService.listAndCount()

  console.log(`Hello! You have ${count} product(s)`)
}
```

In the loader you resolve the `IProductModuleService`, then use its `listAndCount` method to log in the terminal the number of products in the store.

---

## Medusa Configuration Parameter

When the loader function is created outside a module, it receives the Medusa configurations defined in `medusa-config.js` as a second parameter.

For example:

```ts title="src/loaders/hello-world.ts"
import { MedusaContainer } from "@medusajs/medusa"
import { ConfigModule } from "@medusajs/types"

export default async function (
  container: MedusaContainer, 
  config: ConfigModule
) {
  console.log(`You have ${
    Object.values(config.modules || {}).length
  } modules!`)
}
```

This loader logs on application start-up the number of modules defined in your Medusa configurations.
