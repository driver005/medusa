In the previous chapters, you got a brief introduction to Medusa’s basic concepts. However, to build a custom commerce application, you need a deeper understanding of how you can utilize these concepts for your business use case.

The next chapters dive deeper into each concept. By the end of these chapters, you’ll be able to:

- Expose API routes with control over authentication, parsing request bodies, and more.
- Manage data models in services.
- Create relationships between modules.
- Create data models with complex fields and relations.
- Create loaders outside of modules.
- Access events payloads.
- Create advanced workflows and configure retries and timeout.
- Add new pages to the Medusa Admin.
