In this chapter, you’ll learn what batch jobs are and how to create them.

## What are Batch Jobs and Strategies?

A batch job is a task performed asynchronously and iteratively in the background of your Medusa application. The task's implementation is defined in a batch job strategy.

The Medusa application provides API Routes to create a batch job and tracks its progress. You can also create it using the `BatchJobService`'s `create` method.

When a batch job is created, the associated batch job strategy is used to process it.

## How to Create a Batch Job Strategy?

A batch job strategy is a class created in a TypeScript or JavaScript file under the `src/strategies` directory. The class must extend the `AbstractBatchJobStrategy` class from the `@medusajs/medusa` package.

For example, create the file `src/strategies/custom.ts` with the following content:

export const highlights = [
  ["8", "", "A unique identifier associated with the strategy."],
  ["9", "", "The type of batch job that this strategy is used for."],
  ["11", "processJob", "Defines the task to perform when the batch job is processed."],
  ["14", "buildTemplate", "This method is only useful if your batch job provides a template file or text that users can download."]
]

```ts title="src/strategies/custom.ts" highlights={highlights}
import {
  AbstractBatchJobStrategy,
  BatchJobService,
} from "@medusajs/medusa"

class CustomJobStrategy extends AbstractBatchJobStrategy {
  protected batchJobService_: BatchJobService
  static identifier = "custom-strategy"
  static batchType = "custom"

  async processJob(batchJobId: string): Promise<void> {
    console.log("Processing the batch job!")
  }
  async buildTemplate(): Promise<string> {
    return ""
  }
}

export default CustomJobStrategy
```

This creates a batch job strategy implementing the required properties and methods.

### Properties

A batch job strategy must implement the following properties:

- `identifier`: A unique identifier associated with the strategy.
- `batchType`: The type of batch job that this strategy is used for. A batch job has a type, and, when it's created, the strategy having that type is used to process the job.

### Methods

A batch job strategy must implement the following methods:

- `processJob`: Defines the task to perform when the batch job is processed.
- `buildTemplate`: This method is only useful if your batch job provides a template file or text that users can download. For example, you can return a template CSV file that showcases the accepted CSV format for product import. If your batch job doesn’t support that, you can return an empty string.

A batch job strategy can also implement methods that run before and after a batch job is processed or when it fails. Refer to the Batch Job Strategy reference for all available methods.

## When to Use

<Note title="Use batch jobs when" type="success">

- You’re implementing an asynchronous job that’s triggered manually.
- You're tracking the status of the asynchronous job.
- You're keeping track of all batch job executions, which are stored in the database.

</Note>

<Note title="Don’t use batch jobs if" type="error">

- You want to trigger the asynchronous job automatically. Instead, use scheduled jobs. You can also create the batch job in a scheduled job.
- You want the task to be performed and finished before consecutive tasks. Instead, use a service.

</Note>

## Test Batch Job Strategy

To test a batch job strategy, use the Admin API Routes to create a batch job of the same type. This is covered in the next chapter.
