In this chapter, you’ll learn how to override a batch job strategy.

## Overview

Medusa defines batch job strategies for different purposes, such as importing products.

You can override a strategy from the Medusa application’s core to customize its implementation. For example, you can override the product-import strategy to handle a custom file structure or format.

## How to Override a Batch Job Strategy

To override a batch job strategy, create a new batch job strategy and set its `batchType` property to the same type as the original batch job strategy.

For example:

```ts title="src/strategies/custom-product-import.ts" highlights={[["7", "", "Use the same type as the original batch job strategy."]]}
import {
  AbstractBatchJobStrategy,
  BatchJobService,
} from "@medusajs/medusa"

class CustomImportProductStrategy 
  extends AbstractBatchJobStrategy {
    static batchType = "product-import"
    // ...
  }

export default CustomImportProductStrategy
```

This creates a new batch job strategy and sets its type to `product-import`.

Then, when you create a batch job of the same type, the Medusa application resolves and uses your custom batch job strategy instead of the one defined in Medusa.
