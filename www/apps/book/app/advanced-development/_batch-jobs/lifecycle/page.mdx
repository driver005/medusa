In this chapter, you’ll learn about the different lifecycle stages of a batch job based on its status.

## created

When a batch job is created through the API route or using the `BatchJobService`, its status is changed to `created` and the `batch.created` event is emitted.

## pre_processed

Once the `batch.created` event is emitted, the associated batch job strategy is resolved and its `preProcessBatchJob` method is executed.

Then, the batch job’s status is changed to `pre_processed` and the `batch.pre_processed` event is triggered.

## confirmed

After the batch job’s status is changed to `pre_processed`, it’s confirmed automatically if the job’s `dry_run` attribute is disabled (which is, by default). The batch job’s status is changed to `confirmed` and the `batch.confirmed` event is triggered.

<Note title="Tip">

If you enabled the `dry_run` attribute when you created the batch job, you must confirm it manually either through the [API route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#batch-jobs_postbatchjobsbatchjobconfirmprocessing) or the `BatchJobService`'s `confirm` method.

## processing and completed

Once the `batch.confirmed` event is emitted, the batch job’s status is changed to `processing` and the `batch.processing` event is emitted. Then, the batch job strategy’s `process` method is executed.

Once the processing is done, the status of the batch job is changed to `completed` and the `batch.completed` event is emitted.

## Other Lifecycle Stages

The following lifecycle stages occur only in specific cases:

- `canceled`: If you cancel a batch job using the [API route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#batch-jobs_postbatchjobsbatchjobcancel) or `BatchJobService`'s `cancel` method, the batch job’s status is changed to `canceled` and the `batch.canceled` event is emitted.
- `failed`: If an error occurs during any stage, the batch job’s status is changed to `failed` and the `batch.failed` event is emitted.
