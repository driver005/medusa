In this chapter, you’ll learn how to create and process a batch job

<Note type="check">

The API routes used in this chapter require admin user authentication, and the authentication token is referred to in code snippets as `<API_TOKEN>`. Refer to [this guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#authentication) on authenticating admin users.

</Note>

## 1. Start Medusa Application

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

## 2. Create a Batch Job

Use the [Create Batch Job API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#batch-jobs_postbatchjobs) to create a new batch job with the same type as the batch job strategy.

For example:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:9000/admin/batch-jobs' \
-H 'x-medusa-access-token: <API_TOKEN>' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "type": "custom",
    "context": { }
}'
```

In the request body of this API route, you must pass two parameters:

- `type`: The batch job’s type. You use `custom`, which is the type of batch job strategy created in the previous chapter.
- `context`: An object holding any additional details you want to pass to the batch job.

This API route creates a batch job in the database. The Medusa application then triggers the processing of the batch job asynchronously.

## 3. Retrieve Batch Job Status

To check the current status of the batch job, send a request to the [Get a Batch Job API route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#batch-jobs_getbatchjobsbatchjob):

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:9000/admin/batch-jobs/<BATCH_JOB_ID>' \
-H 'x-medusa-access-token: <API_TOKEN>'
```

Replace `<BATCH_JOB_ID>` with the ID of the batch job returned in the previous step.

This API route returns the batch job object. Among its properties, the `status` property indicates the status of the batch job. If it started processing, the status is `processing`. If it’s completed, the status is `completed`.

## 4. Check Console

Once the batch job’s status is `completed`, check the terminal. You’ll find the following messages:

```bash
info:    Processing batch.created which has 1 subscribers
info:    Processing batch.pre_processed which has 0 subscribers
info:    Processing batch.confirmed which has 1 subscribers
Processing the batch job!
info:    Processing batch.processing which has 0 subscribers
info:    Processing batch.completed which has 0 subscribers
```

These messages indicate the different stages of the batch job’s lifecycle. Whenever the batch job’s status is changed, an event is triggered to allow batch job strategies to handle them.

When the batch job’s status is `confirmed`, the batch job is processed, which is why the `Processing the batch job!` message is logged.

In the next chapter, you’ll learn more about the batch job’s lifecycle.

## Alternative Method: BatchJobService

You can alternatively create and process a batch job using the `BatchJobService`.

Refer to the `BatchJobService` reference to learn how to use the `create` method.
