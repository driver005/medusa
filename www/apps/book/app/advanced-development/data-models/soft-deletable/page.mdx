In this document, you'll learn how to create soft-deletable data models.

## What is a Soft-Deletable Model?

A soft-deletable data model is a model whose records aren't actually removed from the database when they're deleted.

Instead, their `deleted_at` field is set to the date the record was deleted.

When retrieving or listing records of that data model, records having their `deleted_at` field set aren't retrieved unless the `withDeleted` filter is provided.

## How to Create a Soft-Deletable Model?

To create a soft-deletable model, first, add the following filter decorator to the data model class:

```ts title="src/module/hello/models/my-soft-deletable.ts" highlights={[["7"]]}
// other imports...
import { Entity, Filter } from "@mikro-orm/core"
import { DALUtils } from "@medusajs/utils"
import { BaseEntity } from "@medusajs/utils"

@Entity()
@Filter(DALUtils.mikroOrmSoftDeletableFilterOptions)
class MySoftDeletable extends BaseEntity {
  // ...
}

export default MySoftDeletable
```

Then, add a `deleted_at` field to the data model:

```ts highlights={[["7"], ["8"]]}
// other imports...
import { Property } from "@mikro-orm/core"

class MySoftDeletable extends BaseEntity {
  // ...

  @Property({ columnType: "timestamptz", nullable: true })
  deleted_at: Date | null = null
}
```

## Manage Soft-Deletable Models

Services extending the service factory have methods to soft delete and restore records for all models specified during its creation.

### Soft Delete a Record

For example, to soft delete a `MySoftDeletable` record:

```ts
await helloModuleService.softDelete([
  "id_123", "id_321",
])
```

The method receives an array of IDs of records to delete.

### Retrieve Soft-Deleted Records

The `retrieve`, `list`, and `listAndCount` methods accept as a second parameter a configuration object.

To retrieve soft-deleted records, set `withDeleted` to `true` in the configuration object passed as a second parameter.

For example:

```ts
const deletedRecords = await helloModuleService
  .listMySoftDeletables({
    // ...
  }, {
    withDeleted: true,
  })
```

### Restore a Soft-Deleted Record

To restore a `MySoftDeletable` record:

```ts
await helloModuleService.restore([
  "id_123", "id_321",
])
```

The method also receives an array of IDs of records to restore.

If the data model isn't the main data model, its method names are `softDelete` and `restore` suffixed with the plural name of the model. For example, `softDeleteMySoftDeletable`.
