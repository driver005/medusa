In the next chapters, youâ€™ll learn about plugins, their use in your application, and how to create and publish plugins.

## What is a Plugin?

A plugin is an NPM package that consists of Medusa customizations. It adds new functionalities or integrates third-party services, such as a CMS or MeiliSearch.

Plugins can be added or removed from your Medusa application without causing side effects.

<Note title="Use plugins when" type="success">

- You're integrating a third-party service into your Medusa application.
- You're creating reusable Medusa application customizations.
- You're providing features that are specific to a Medusa application, such as a migration tool from another platform to Medusa.

</Note>

## Plugins vs Modules

Both plugins and modules are NPM packages that can be installed on your Medusa application without affecting the overall system.

However, there are key differences between plugins and modules:

      <Table.HeaderCell className="!text-center">Plugins</Table.HeaderCell>

      <Table.Cell><XMark className="mx-auto" /></Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell><Check className="mx-auto" /></Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>Make architectural changes, such as change the pub/sub service used to emit events.</Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell><XMark className="mx-auto" /></Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell><Check className="mx-auto" /></Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
  </Table.Body>
</Table>

## Official and Community Plugins

Medusa provides official plugins that integrate third-party services like Algolia, SendGrid, S3, and more.

You can also check out the [Plugins Library](https://medusajs.com/plugins/) for a full list of plugins created by the community.

## How are Plugins Installed?

Plugins are installed through NPM. Then, you must add them to the `plugins` array exported as part of the configurations in `medusa-config.js`.

If you check the `plugins` array in your `medusa-config.js`, you'll find a few plugins already installed:

```js title="medusa-config.js"
const plugins = [
  `medusa-fulfillment-manual`,
  `medusa-payment-manual`,
  {
    resolve: `@medusajs/file-local`,
    options: {
      upload_dir: "uploads",
    },
  },
  {
    resolve: "@medusajs/admin",
    /** @type {import('@medusajs/admin').PluginOptions} */
    options: {
      autoRebuild: true,
      develop: {
        open: false,
      },
    },
  },
]
```

The items in the `plugins` array can either be:

- A string which is the plugin's name. In this case, the plugin doesn't require any options;
- Or an object having the following properties:
    - `resolve`: the plugin's name.
    - `options`: An object of options to pass to the plugin.

### Configure Admin Customizations

If a plugin provides customizations to the admin dashboard, you can pass a special option `enableUI` whose value is a boolean indicating whether the admin customizations should be enabled. By default, its value is `false`.

For example:

```js title="medusa-config.js"
const plugins = [
  // ...
  {
    resolve: `medusa-plugin-custom`,
    options: {
      // other options...
      enableUI: true,
    },
  },
]
```
