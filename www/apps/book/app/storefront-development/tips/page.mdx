In this chapter, you’ll find tips to help you build a storefront.

## Connect to the Medusa Application

<Note type="soon">

Support for Medusa v2 in Medusa React and the JS Client is coming soon.

</Note>

To send requests from the storefront to the Medusa application’s Store API Routes, you have three options:

- **For React-based storefronts**: use Medusa React. It provides you with the necessary hooks to retrieve or manipulate data from your Medusa application.
- **For JavaScript frameworks**: use Medusa’s JavaScript Client in any JavaScript framework. This NPM package facilitates interacting with the backend’s REST APIs.
- **For other frontend technologies**:  interact directly with the Medusa application by sending requests to its [Store REST APIs](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store).

## Configure CORS

The Medusa application’s API routes are guarded by a CORS middleware. Make sure to set the `storeCors` property of the `http` configuration in `medusa-config.js` to the storefront’s URL.

For example:

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = {
  projectConfig: {
    http: {
      storeCors: "http://localhost:3000",
      // ...
    }
  },
  // ...
}
```

## Use Publishable API Keys

Publishable API keys specify the scope of a request. Admin users create them, and they can only be used on the client-side, such as in a storefront.

Publishable API keys are associated with sales channels. Then, when the publishable API key is passed in the header of a request, the Medusa application automatically infers what sales channel is being used.

<Note>

Products, carts, and orders are associated with a sales channel. If you don’t specify a sales channel or a publishable API key, the products, carts, and orders are associated with the default sales channel.

</Note>

Publishable API keys are provided by the [API key commerce module](!resources!/commerce-modules/api-key).
