## Features

In Medusa, merchants can create dynamic discounts that act as a template for other discounts. With dynamic discounts, merchants don't have to repeat certain conditions every time they want to create a new discount.

The discount generator plugin allows merchants and developers to generate new discounts from a dynamic discount either using the `/discount-code` API Route or the `DiscountGeneratorService`.

## Install the Discount Generator Plugin

To install the Discount Generator plugin, run the following command in the directory of your Medusa application:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install medusa-plugin-discount-generator
```

Next, add the plugin into the `plugins` array in `medusa-config.js`:

```js title="medusa-config.js"
const plugins = [
  // ...
  {
    resolve: `medusa-plugin-discount-generator`,
  },
]
```

---

## Test the Plugin

<Note type="check">

- Dynamic discount. Create it using either the [Medusa Admin](!user-guide!/discounts/create) or the [Admin API routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#discounts_postdiscounts).

</Note>

To test the plugin, start the Medusa application:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

Then, send a `POST` request to the `/discount-code` API Route:

```bash apiTesting testApiUrl="http://localhost:9000/discount-code/" testApiMethod="POST" testBodyParams={{"discount_code": "TEST"}}
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/discount-code/ \ 
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    "discount_code": "TEST"
  }'
```

The API Route accepts in the request body the parameter `discount_code` which is a string indicating the code of the dynamic discount to generate a new discount from.

The API Route then creates the new discount from the dynamic discount and returns it in the response.

---

## Use DiscountGeneratorService

Use the `DiscountGeneratorService` to generate a discount in other resources.

For example:

```ts title="src/api/store/generate-discount-code/route.ts"
import type {
  MedusaRequest,
  MedusaResponse,
} from "@medusajs/medusa"

export const POST = async (
  req: MedusaRequest,
  res: MedusaResponse
) => {
  // skipping validation for simplicity
  const { dynamicCode } = req.body
  const discountGenerator = req.scope.resolve(
    "discountGeneratorService"
  )
  const code =
    await discountGenerator.generateDiscount(dynamicCode)

  res.json({
    code,
  })
}
```

The `DiscountGeneratorService` has the method `generateDiscount`. It accepts the code of a dynamic discount as a parameter and creates a new discount having the same attributes as the dynamic discount, but with a different, random code.
