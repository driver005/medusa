## Features

The manual fulfillment plugin is a minimal plugin that allows merchants to handle fulfillments manually. This plugin is installed by default in your Medusa application.

The manual fulfillment plugin is similar to a cash-on-delivery (COD) fulfillment plugin. While the merchant can use shipping and fulfillment functionalities, they only change data in the database. The merchant has to handle the actual fulfillment of the order manually.

## Install the Manual Fulfillment Plugin

To install the Manual Fulfillment plugin, run the following command in the directory of your Medusa application:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install medusa-fulfillment-manual
```

Next, add the plugin into the `plugins` array in `medusa-config.js`:

```js title="medusa-config.js"
const plugins = [
  // ...
  {
    resolve: `medusa-fulfillment-manual`,
  },
]
```

---

## Test the Plugin

To test the plugin, start the Medusa application:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

Then, you must enable the Manual Fulfillment Provider in at least one region to use it. You can do that using either the [Medusa Admin](!user-guide!/settings/regions/providers), or the [Admin API Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#regions_postregionsregionfulfillmentproviders).

After enabling the provider, you must add shipping options for that provider. You can also do that using either the [Medusa Admin](!user-guide!/settings/regions/shipping-options) or the [Admin API Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#shipping-options_postshippingoptions).

Finally, try to place an order using either a [storefront](../../../nextjs-starter/page.mdx) or the [Store API Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store). You can use the shipping options you created for the fulfillment provider.
