In this document, you’ll learn what a payment is and how it's created, captured, and refunded.

## What's a Payment?

When a payment session is authorized, a payment, represented by the `Payment` data model, is created. This payment is an authorized amount that’s later captured or refunded.

A payment carries along many of the data and relations of a payment session:

- It belongs to the same payment collection.
- It’s associated with the same payment provider, which handles further payment processing.
- It stores the payment session’s `data` field in its `data` field, as it’s still useful for the payment provider’s processing.

## Capture Payments

When a payment is captured, a capture, represented by the `Capture` data model, is created. It holds details related to the capture, such as the amount, the capture date, and more.

The payment can also be captured incrementally, each time a capture record is created for that amount.

## Refund Payments

An amount of a payment can be refunded if it’s already captured. Once it’s refunded, a refund, represented by the `Refund` data model, is created. It holds details related to the refund, such as the amount, refund date, and more.

A payment can be refunded multiple times, and each time a refund record is created for that refund.
