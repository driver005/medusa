In this document, you’ll learn how the Payment Module supports listening to webhook events.

## What's a Webhook Event?

A webhook event is sent from a third-party payment provider to your application. It indicates a change in a payment’s status. This is useful in different cases such as when a payment is being processed asynchronously or when a request is interrupted.

---

## processEvent Method

The Payment Module’s main service (`IPaymentModuleService`) provides a `processEvent` method used to handle incoming webhook events from third-party providers. The method delegates the handling to the associated payment provider, which returns the event's details.

If the event's details indicate that the payment should be authorized, then the `authorizePaymentSession` of the main service is executed on the specified payment session.

If the event's details indicate that the payment should be captured, then the `capturePayment` of the main service is executed on the payment of the specified payment session.

You can use this method in your webhook listener API routes or endpoints.

<Note>

Medusa V2 implements a webhook listener at the `/hooks/payment/[provider]` API route, where `[provider]` is the ID of the provider (for example, `stripe`). You can use that webhook listener in your third-party payment provider's configurations.

</Note>

For example:

```ts
await paymentModuleService.processEvent({
  provider: "stripe",
  payload: {
    // webhook event data
  },
})
```
