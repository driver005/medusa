When Commerce Modules are used together in a Medusa application, the Medusa application handles building the relations between these modules.

This document showcases the relation between the Payment Module and other Commerce Modules.

## Cart Module

The Payment Module can be used with the Cart Module to accept payment for the cart during checkout.

Learn more about this relation in [this documentation](../payment-collection/page.mdx#usage-with-the-cart-module).

## Region Module

You can specify for each region which payment providers are available. The Medusa application forms a relation between the `PaymentProvider` and the `Region` data models.

This increases the flexibility of your store.

For example, paired with other modules, such as the Cart Module, you only show during checkout the payment providers associated with the cart's region.
