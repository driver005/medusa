In this document, you’ll learn how the API Key module generates, revokes, and verifies tokens.

## API Key Types

There are two types of API keys:

- `publishable`: A public key used in client applications, such as a storefront.
- `secret`: A secret key used for authentication and verification purposes, such as an admin user’s authentication token or a password reset token.

The API key’s type is stored in the `type` field of the `ApiKey` data model.

## Publishable Token Generation

When you create a publishable API key, its token is generated using [the `randomBytes` method of Node.js’s crypto package](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/crypto.html#cryptorandombytessize-callback). The token is `32` characters long and is hex-encoded. It’s stored in the `token` field of the `ApiKey` data model.

## Secret Token Generation

When you create a secret API key, three tokens are generated:

- A token that’s `32` characters long and hex-encoded. It’s generated using the `randomBytes` method of Node.js’s crypto package.
- A salt token that’s `15` characters long and hex-encoded. It’s also generated using the `randomBytes` method.
- A hashed token is generated from the token and salt token using [the `scrypt` method of Node.js’s crypto package](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/crypto.html#x509tostring). It’s `64` characters long and hex-encoded.

The salt and hashed tokens are stored in the `ApiKey` data model’s `salt` and `token` fields, respectively.

## API Key Expiration

An API key expires when it’s revoked using the `revoke` method of the module’s main service. The method sets the API key’s `revoked_at` and `revoked_by` fields accordingly.

The associated token is no longer usable or verifiable.

---

## Token Verification

To verify a token received as an input or in a request, the `authenticate` method of the module’s main service goes through all non-expired API keys. It recalculates the hash token using the supplied token and the API key’s `salt` field.

If the calculated hashed token matches the one in the database, the token is considered verified.
