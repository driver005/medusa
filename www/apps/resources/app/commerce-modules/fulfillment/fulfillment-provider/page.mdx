In this document, you’ll learn what a fulfillment provider is.

## What’s a Fulfillment Provider?

A fulfillment provider implements the functionality of fulfilling items, typically using a third-party integration. It’s represented by the `FulfillmentProvider` data model.

## How to Create a Fulfillment Provider?

A fulfillment provider is a TypeScript or JavaScript class that extends the `AbstractFulfillmentProviderService` class imported from `@medusajs/utils`. You can create it part of your Medusa application codebase, in a plugin, or in a provider module.

## Configure Fulfillment Providers

The Fulfillment Module accepts a `providers` option that allows you to register providers in your application. When the Medusa application starts, it registers these modules and adds records of the `FulfillmentProvider` for them.

Learn more about the `providers` option in [this documentation](../module-options/page.mdx).
