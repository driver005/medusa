When Commerce Modules are used together in a Medusa application, the Medusa application handles building the relations between these modules.

This document showcases the relation between the Fulfillment Module and other Commerce Modules.

When the Fulfillment and Stock Location modules are used together, a fulfillment set can be conditioned to a specific stock location.

The Medusa application forms a relation between the `FulfillmentSet` and `StockLocation` data models.
