## Line Items

A line item, represented by the `LineItem` data model, is a product added to the cart. A cart has multiple line items.

A line item stores some of the product’s fields, such as the `product_title` and `product_description`. It also stores data related to the item’s quantity and price.

<Note>

A product can be from the [Product Module](../../product/page.mdx) but can also be a custom item used only in this cart.

## Shipping Methods

A shipping method, represented by the `ShippingMethod` data model, is the method used to fulfill the items in the cart after the order is placed. A cart can have more than one shipping method.

If the shipping method is created from a shipping option, typically available through the Fulfillment Module, its ID is stored in the `shipping_option_id`.

A shipping method can also be a custom method associated with this cart only.

### data Field

When fulfilling the order after its placed, you may use a third-party fulfillment provider that requires additional custom data to be passed along from the checkout process.

The `ShippingMethod` data model has a `data` field. It's an object used to store custom data relevant later for fulfillment.

In the Medusa application, it's the `data` is passed to the Fulfillment Module when fulfilling items.
