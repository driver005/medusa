In this document, you’ll learn about an order’s transactions and usefulness.

## What is a Transaction?

A transaction represents any order payment process, such as capturing or refunding an amount. It’s represented by the `Transaction` data model.

The transaction’s main purpose is to ensure a correct balance between paid and outstanding amounts.

## Transaction Reference

The Order Module doesn’t provide payment processing functionalities, so it doesn’t store payments that can be processed. For that, use the Payment Module or custom logic.

The `Transaction` data model has two fields that determine which data model and record holds the actual payment’s details:

- `reference`: indicates the table’s name in the database. For example, `payment` if you’re using the Payment Module.
- `reference_id`: indicates the ID of the record in the table. For example, `pay_123`.

## Checking Outstanding Amount

The order’s total is stored in the `OrderSummary`'s `total` field. To check the outstanding amount of the order, the transaction amounts of an order are summed. Then:

<Table>
  <Table.Header>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.HeaderCell>Condition</Table.HeaderCell>
      <Table.HeaderCell>Result</Table.HeaderCell>
    </Table.Row>
  </Table.Header>
  <Table.Body>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
      
      summary’s total - transaction amounts total = 0
      
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
      
      There’s no outstanding amount.
      
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
      
      summary’s total - transaction amounts total > 0
      
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
      
      The customer owes additional payment to the merchant.
      
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
      
      summary’s total - transaction amounts total < 0
      
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
      
      The merchant owes the customer a refund.
      
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
  </Table.Body>
</Table>
