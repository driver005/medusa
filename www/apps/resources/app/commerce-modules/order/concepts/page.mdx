In this document, you’ll learn about orders and their general fields.

## Order Data Model

An order represents a customer purchase in your store. The `Order` data model holds the information about that purchase.

---

## Order Items

The items purchased in the order are represented by the `OrderItem` data model. An order can have multiple items.

Learn more about order items in [this guide](../order-items/page.mdx).

## Order’s Shipping Method

An order has one or more shipping methods used to handle item shipment. Each shipping method is represented by the `ShippingMethod` data model that holds its details.

### data Field

When fulfilling the order, you may use a third-party fulfillment provider that requires additional custom data to be passed along from the order creation process.

The `ShippingMethod` data model has a `data` field. It’s an object used to store custom data relevant later for fulfillment.

In the Medusa application, the `data` is passed to the Fulfillment Module when fulfilling items.

---

## Order Totals

The order’s total amounts (including tax total, total after an item is returned, etc…) are represented by the `OrderSummary` data model. An order can have multiple summaries.

---

## Order Payments

Payments made on an order, whether they’re capture or refund payments, are recorded as transactions represented by the `Transaction` data model.

An order can have multiple transactions. The sum of these transactions must be equal to the order summary’s total. Otherwise, there’s an outstanding amount.

Learn more about transactions in [this guide](../transactions/page.mdx).
