When Commerce Modules are used together in a Medusa application, the Medusa application handles building the relations between these modules.

This document showcases the relation between the Order Module and other Commerce Modules.

## Sales Channel Module

Orders can be scoped to a sales channel. The Medusa application forms a relation between the `Order` and the `SalesChannel` data models.

This is useful for omnichannel purposes. Associating an order with a sales channel in turn ensures that associated products, inventory, and other details are also scoped to that sales channel.
