When Commerce Modules are used together in a Medusa application, the Medusa application handles building the relations between these modules.

This document showcases the relation between the Product Module and other Commerce Modules.

## Pricing Module

A product variantâ€™s prices are stored as money amounts belonging to a price set. The Medusa application forms a relation between the `ProductVariant` and the `PriceSet` data models.

So, to add prices for a product variant, create a price set and add the prices as money amounts to it.

## Sales Channel Module

A product can have different availability in different sales channels. The Medusa application forms a relation between the `Product` and `SalesChannel` data models.

## Inventory Module

Each product variant has different inventory details. The Medusa application forms a relation between the `ProductVariant` and `InventoryItem` data models.

When the `manage_inventory` field of a product variant is enabled, you can manage the variant's inventory in different locations through this relation.
