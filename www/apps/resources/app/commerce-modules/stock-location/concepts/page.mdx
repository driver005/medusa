In this document, youâ€™ll learn about the main concepts in the Stock Location Module, and how data is stored and related.

## Stock Location

A stock location, represented by the `StockLocation` data model, represents a location where stock items are kept. For example, a warehouse.

The `InventoryLevel` and `ReservationItem` data models of the Inventory Module are associated with the `StockLocation` to provide inventory details per location. Learn more about this relation in [this guide](../relations-to-other-modules/page.mdx).

## StockLocationAddress

The `StockLocationAddress` data model belongs to the `StockLocation` data model. It provides more detailed information of the location, such as country code or street address.
