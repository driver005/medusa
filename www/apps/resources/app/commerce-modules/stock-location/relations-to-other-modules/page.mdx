When Commerce Modules are used together in a Medusa application, the Medusa application handles building the relations between these modules.

This document showcases the relation between the Stock Location Module and other Commerce Modules.

## Inventory Module

Reservation items and inventory items are associated with a location. The Medusa application forms a relation between the `ReservationItem` and `StockLocation` data models, and the `InventoryLevel` and `StockLocation` data models.

With this relation, stock and reserved quantity is specific to a location, providing you with more flexibility. The location can be as simple as having only a name, and more flexible by adding more address details to it.
