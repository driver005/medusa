When Commerce Modules are used together in a Medusa application, the Medusa application handles building the relations between these modules.

This document showcases the relation between the Promotion Module and other Commerce Modules.

## Cart Module

When the Cart and Promotion modules are used together, the Medusa application links the `Promotion` data model to the `Cart`, `LineItemAdjustment`, and `ShippingMethodAdjustment` data models of the Cart Module.

A promotion is linked to a cart when a promotion is applied on the cart. Adjustments on items and shipping methods, represented by the `LineItemAdjustment` and `ShippingMethodAdjustment` data models, are linked to the promotion as well.
