In this document, you’ll learn about the concepts in the Promotion Module.

## Promotion

A promotion, represented by the `Promotion` data model, represents a discount applied on cart items, shipping methods, or entire orders.

A promotion has two types:

- `standard`: A standard promotion with rules.
- `buyget`: “A buy X get Y” promotion with rules.

      A coupon code that gives customers 10% off their entire order.

      <Table.Cell>

      Buy two shirts and get 10% off the entire order.

      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>

      A discount applied automatically for VIP customers that removes 10% off their shipping method’s amount.

      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>

      Spend $100 and get free shipping.

      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
  </Table.Body>
</Table>

### PromotionRule

A promotion can be restricted by a set of rules, each rule is represented by the `PromotionRule` data model. For example, you can create a promotion that only customers of the `VIP` customer group can use it.

![A diagram showcasing the relation between Promotion and PromotionRule](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1709833196/Medusa%20Resources/promotion-promotion-rule_msbx0w.jpg)

A `PromotionRule`'s `field` field indicates the field's name to which this rule is applied. For example, `customer_group_id`. Its value is stored in the `PromotionRuleValue` data model. So, a rule can have multiple values.

When testing whether a promotion can be applied to a cart, the rule's `field` field and its values are tested on the cart itself. For example, the cart's customer must be part of the customer group(s) indicated in the promotion rule's value.

### Flexible Rules

The `PromotionRule`'s `operator` field adds more flexibility to the rule’s condition rather than simple equality (`eq`).

For example, to restrict the promotion to only `VIP` and `B2B` customer groups:

- Add a `PromotionRule` with its `field` field set to `customer_group_id` and `operator` field to `in`.
- Add two `PromotionRuleValue` associated with the rule: one with the value `VIP` and the other `B2B`.

In this case, a customer’s group must be in the `VIP` and `B2B` set of values to use the promotion.

## Application Method

The `ApplicationMethod` data model defines how a promotion is applied:

<Table>
  <Table.Header>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.HeaderCell>
      
      field
      
      </Table.HeaderCell>
      <Table.HeaderCell>
      
      Purpose
      
      </Table.HeaderCell>
    </Table.Row>
  </Table.Header>
  <Table.Body>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>

      `type`

      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>

      Does the promotion discount a fixed amount or a percentage?

      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>

      `target_type`

      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>

      Is the promotion applied on a cart item, shipping method, or the entire order?

      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>

      `allocation`

      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>

      Is the discounted amount applied on each item or split between the applicable items?

      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
  </Table.Body>
</Table>

### Target Promotion Rules

When the promotion is applied to a cart item or a shipping method, you can restrict which items/shipping methods the promotion is applied to.

The `ApplicationMethod` data model has a collection of `PromotionRule` records to restrict which items or shipping methods the promotion applies to. The `target_rules` field represents this relation. 

![A diagram showcasing the target_rules relation between the ApplicationMethod and PromotionRule data models](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1709898273/Medusa%20Resources/application-method-target-rules_hqaymz.jpg)

In this example, the promotion is only applied on products in the cart having the SKU `SHIRT`.

### Buy Promotion Rules

When the promotion’s type is `buyget`, you must specify the “buy X” condition. For example, a cart must have two shirts before the promotion can be applied.

The application method has a collection of `PromotionRule` items to define the “buy X” rule. The `buy_rules` field represents this relation. 

![A diagram showcasing the buy_rules relation between the ApplicationMethod and PromotionRule data models](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1709898453/Medusa%20Resources/application-method-buy-rules_djjuhw.jpg)

In this example, the cart must have two products with the SKU `SHIRT` for the promotion to be applied.

## Campaign

A `Campaign` combines promotions under the same conditions, such as start and end dates.

### Campaign Limits

Each campaign has a budget represented by the `CampaignBudget` data model. The budget limits how many times the promotion can be used.

There are two types of budgets:

- `spend`: An amount that, when crossed, the promotion becomes unusable. For example, if the amount limit is set to `$100`, and the total amount of usage of this promotion crosses that threshold, the promotion can no longer be applied.
- `usage`: The number of times that a promotion can be used. For example, if the usage limit is set to `10`, the promotion can be used only 10 times by customers. After that, it can no longer be applied.
