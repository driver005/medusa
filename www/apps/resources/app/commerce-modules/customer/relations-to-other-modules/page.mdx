When Commerce Modules are used together in a Medusa application, the Medusa application handles building the relations between these modules.

This document showcases the relation between the Customer Module and other Commerce Modules.

A customer has a cart to purchase items from the store. The Medusa application forms a relation between the `Customer` and the `Cart` data models.
