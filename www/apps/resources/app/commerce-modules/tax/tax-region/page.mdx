In this document, youâ€™ll learn about tax regions and how to use them with the Region Module.

## What is a Tax Region?

A tax region, represented by the `TaxRegion` data model, stores settings related to a region that your store serves.

Tax regions can inherit settings and rules from a parent tax region.

Each tax region has tax rules and a tax provider.

## Settings Per Region with the Region Module

By combining the Tax and [Region](../../region/page.mdx) Modules, as done in the Medusa application, each region has its own tax providers and rates.

This adds more flexibility to your commerce store.
