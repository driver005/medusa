In this document, youâ€™ll learn how the Auth Module handles authentication using providers.

## What's an Auth Provider?

An auth provider is a TypeScript or JavaScript class used to authenticate customers and users. Each provider implements the authentication logic based on its purpose.

For example, the `emailpass` provider authenticates a user using their email and password, whereas the `google` provider authenticates users using their Google account.

## The Auth Provider Class

An auth provider implements the `AbstractAuthModuleProvider` class imported from the `@medusajs/utils` package. The provider must implement the `authenticate` method that authenticates a user.

When you call the `authenticate` method of the Auth Module's main service (`IAuthModuleService`), the method resolves the specified provider and calls its `authenticate` method passing it the second parameter it received:

```ts
const data = await authModuleService.authenticate(
    "emailpass",
    // passed to auth provider
    {
      // ...
    }
  )
```

It also returns the same data returned by the auth provider.
