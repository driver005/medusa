When Commerce Modules are used together in a Medusa application, the Medusa application handles building the relations between these modules.

This document showcases the relation between the Pricing Module and other Commerce Modules.

## Product Module

A product variantâ€™s prices are stored as prices belonging to a price set. The Medusa application forms a relation between the `ProductVariant` and the `PriceSet`.

So, when you want to add prices for a product variant, you create a price set and add the prices to it. You can then benefit from adding rules to prices or using the `calculatePrices` method to retrieve the price of a product variant within a specified context.
