# {metadata.title}

In this document, you'll learn how prices are calculated under the hood when you use the `calculatePrices` method of the Pricing Module interface.

## Overview

The `calculatePrices` method accepts the ID of one or more price sets and a context. For each price set, it selects two types of prices that best match the context; one belongs to a price list, and one doesn't.

Then, it returns an array of price objects, each price for every supplied price set ID.

---

## Calculation Context

The context is an object passed to the `calculatePrices` method. It must contain at least the `currency_code`. Only prices in the price sets with the same currency code are considered for the price selection.

For example:

```ts
import {
  initialize as initializePricingModule,
} from "@medusajs/pricing"

async function calculatePrice(
  priceSetId: string,
  currencyCode: string
) {
  const pricingModuleService = await initializePricingModule()

  const price = await pricingModuleService.calculatePrices(
    { id: [priceSetId] },
    {
      context: {
        currency_code: currencyCode,
      },
    }
  )
}
```

The context object can also contain any custom rules, with the key being the `rule_field` of a rule type and its value being the rule's value.

For example:

```ts
import {
  initialize as initializePricingModule,
} from "@medusajs/pricing"

async function calculatePrice(
  priceSetId: string,
  currencyCode: string
) {
  const pricingModuleService = await initializePricingModule()

  const price = await pricingModuleService.calculatePrices(
    { id: [priceSetId] },
    {
      context: {
        currency_code: currencyCode,
        region_id: "US",
      },
    }
  )
}
```

## Prices Selection

For each price set, the method selects two prices:

- The calculated price: a price that belongs to a price list. If there are no prices associated with a price list, it’ll be the same as the original price.
- The original price: a price that doesn't belong to a price list.

### Calculated Price Selection Process

![A diagram showcasing the calculated price selection process.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1700574799/Medusa%20Docs/Diagrams/calculated-price_vjnx3j.jpg)

- Find the price set’s associated valid price lists. A price list is considered valid if:
  - The current date is between its start and end dates.
  - The price list's rules satisfy the context's rules.
- If valid price lists are found, the prices within them are sorted by their amount in ascending order. The one having the lowest amount is selected as the calculated price.
- If no valid price list is found, the selected calculated price will be the same as the original price.

### Original Price Selection Process

![A diagram showcasing the original price selection process.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1700574800/Medusa%20Docs/Diagrams/original-price_i47fso.jpg)

- If the price list associated with the calculated price is of type `override`, the selected original price is set to the calculated price.
- If no rules are provided in the context other than the `currency_code`, the default price is selected as the original price. The default price is a price having no rules applied to it.
- Otherwise, if a price exists in any price set with the same rules provided in the context, it's selected as the original price.
- If no price exists with the same rules as the context, all prices satisfying any combination of the provided rules are retrieved.
  - The prices are sorted in descending order by the associated `Price`'s `rules_count`, the `default_priority` of the rule types, and the `priority` of the associated `PriceRule`. The `priority` field has a higher precedence than the `default_priority`.
  - The highest price sorted is selected as the original price since it's considered the best price.

## Returned Calculated Price

After the original and calculated prices are selected, the method will use them to create the following price object for each pr

```ts
const price = {
  id: priceSetId,
  is_calculated_price_price_list: 
    !!calculatedPrice?.price_list_id,
  calculated_amount: parseInt(
    calculatedPrice?.amount || ""
  ) || null,

  is_original_price_price_list: 
    !!originalPrice?.price_list_id,
  original_amount: parseInt(
    originalPrice?.amount || ""
  ) || null,

  currency_code: calculatedPrice?.currency_code || null,

  calculated_price: {
    price_id: calculatedPrice?.id || null,
    price_list_id: calculatedPrice?.price_list_id || null,
    price_list_type: calculatedPrice?.price_list_type || null,
    min_quantity: parseInt(
      calculatedPrice?.min_quantity || ""
    ) || null,
    max_quantity: parseInt(
      calculatedPrice?.max_quantity || ""
    ) || null,
  },

  original_price: {
    price_id: originalPrice?.id || null,
    price_list_id: originalPrice?.price_list_id || null,
    price_list_type: originalPrice?.price_list_type || null,
    min_quantity: parseInt(
      originalPrice?.min_quantity || ""
    ) || null,
    max_quantity: parseInt(
      originalPrice?.max_quantity || ""
    ) || null,
  },
}
```

Where:

- `id`: The ID of the price set from which the price was selected.
- `is_calculated_price_price_list`: whether the calculated price belongs to a price list. As mentioned earlier, if no valid price list is found, the calculated price is set to the original price, which doesn't belong to a price list.
- `calculated_amount`: The amount of the calculated price, or `null` if there isn't a calculated price.
- `is_original_price_price_list`: whether the original price belongs to a price list. As mentioned earlier, if the price list of the calculated price is of type `override`, the original price will be the same as the calculated price.
- `original_amount`: The amount of the original price, or `null` if there isn't an original price.
- `currency_code`: The currency code of the calculated price, or `null` if there isn't a calculated price.
- `calculated_price`: An object containing the calculated price's price details and potentially its associated price list.
- `original_price`: An object containing the original price's price details and potentially its associated price list.

The method returns an array of these price objects.

## Example

Consider the following rule types and price sets:

```ts
const ruleTypes = await pricingModuleService.createRuleTypes([
  {
    name: "Region",
    rule_field: "region_id",
  },
  {
    name: "City",
    rule_field: "city",
  },
])

const priceSet = await pricingModuleService.create({
  rules: [
    { rule_field: "region_id" },
    { rule_field: "city" },
  ],
  prices: [
    //default
    {
      amount: 500,
      currency_code: "EUR",
      rules: {},
    },
    // prices with rules
    {
      amount: 400,
      currency_code: "EUR",
      rules: {
        region_id: "PL",
      },
    },
    {
      amount: 450,
      currency_code: "EUR",
      rules: {
        city: "krakow",
      },
    },
    {
      amount: 500,
      currency_code: "EUR",
      rules: {
        city: "warsaw",
        region_id: "PL",
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

    }

    - Original price selection: since there are no provided rules in the context, the original price is the default price.
    - Calculated price selection: since there are no associated price lists, the calculated price is set to the original price.

    - Original price selection: Since the second price of the price set has the same context as the provided one, it's selected as the original price.
    - Calculated price selection: since there are no associated price lists, the calculated price is set to the original price.

    - Original price selection: The fourth price in the price list is selected based on the following process:
      - There are no prices having the same rules as the context.
      - Retrieve all prices matching some combination of the rules in the context.
      - Sort the prices in descending order by their number of rules, each rule type's default priority, and the priority of the rule values.
        - All rule types, in this case, don't have a priority. So, the sorting depends on the number of rules each price has.
      - The fourth price has two rules, and the second and third have one rule. So, the fourth price is selected as the original price.
    - Calculated price selection: since there are no associated price lists, the calculated price is set to the original price.

    - Original price selection: The process is explained in the Context without Exact Matching Rules section.
    - Calculated price selection: The first price of the price list is selected based on the following process:
      - The price set has a price list associated with it. So, retrieve its prices and sort them in ascending order by their amount.
      - Since the first price of the price list has the lowest amount, it's selected as the calculated price.
