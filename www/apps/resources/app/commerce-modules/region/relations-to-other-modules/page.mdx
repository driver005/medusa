When Commerce Modules are used together in a Medusa application, the Medusa application handles building the relations between these modules.

This document showcases the relation between the Region Module and other Commerce Modules.

## Cart Module

Carts are associated with a region. The Medusa application forms a relation between the `Region` and the `Cart` data models.

The cart then uses the same currency as the region. During checkout, the cart's taxes, payment, and fulfillment providers are available based on the region's settings.
