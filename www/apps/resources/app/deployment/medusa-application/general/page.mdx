# {metadata.title}

<Note type="soon">

The following deployment guide doesn't support Medusa v2 yet.

</Note>

In this guide, you’ll learn the general steps you need to take when deploying your Medusa application.

<Note type="check">

- Production Event Bus Module installed and configured in the Medusa application, such as the [Redis Event Bus Module](../../../architectural-modules/event/redis/page.mdx).
- Production Cache Module installed and configured in the Medusa application, such as the [Redis Cache Module](../../../architectural-modules/cache/redis/page.mdx).
- [GitHub repository with the Medusa application's code](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).

</Note>

## Start Script in package.json

Make sure the `start` script in your `package.json` runs migrations, the `build` command, and the `medusa start` command:

```json title="package.json"
"start": "npm run build && medusa migrations run && medusa start"
```

---

## Set SSL Database Option

In production, it’s recommended to set the [database_extra option](/references/medusa-config#database_extra) in `medusa-config.js` to disable the `ssl.rejectUnauthorized` option:

```js title="medusa-config.js" highlights={[["4"]]}
module.exports = {
  projectConfig: {
    // ...
    database_extra: process.env.NODE_ENV !== "development" ?
      {
        ssl: {
          rejectUnauthorized: false,
        },
      } : {},
  },
}
```

---

## Setup PostgreSQL Database

Your Medusa application must connect to a remote PostgreSQL database. If your hosting provider doesn’t support creating a PostgreSQL database, use [Neon](https://neon.tech/).

Once you set up your PostgreSQL database, make sure to have the connection URL to the database at hand so that you can set it later in your environment variables.

---

## Configure the Admin

If you're using the Medusa Admin plugin, you have two options to deploy it: either with the Medusa application or separately.

### Deploying with the Medusa Application

To deploy the admin with the Medusa application:

1. Your chosen plan must offer at least 2GB of RAM.
2. Enable the autoRebuild option of the admin plugin:

```js title="medusa-config.js" highlights={[["7"]]}
const plugins = [
  // ...
  {
    resolve: "@medusajs/admin",
    /** @type {import('@medusajs/admin').PluginOptions} */
    options: {
      autoRebuild: true,
      // other options...
    },
  },
]
```

Alternatively, you can use a GitHub action to build the admin as explained [here](!docs!/deployment).

### Deploying Separately

To deploy the admin separately, disable the admin plugin's serve option:

```js title="medusa-config.js" highlights={[["10"]]}
const plugins = [
  // ...
  {
    resolve: "@medusajs/admin",
    /** @type {import('@medusajs/admin').PluginOptions} */
    options: {
      // only enable `serve` in development
      // you may need to add the NODE_ENV variable
      // manually
      serve: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development",
      // other options...
    },
  },
]
```

This ensures that the admin isn't built or served in production. You can also change `@medusajs/admin` dependency to be a dev dependency in `package.json`.

You can alternatively remove the admin plugin for the plugins array.

## Setup Architectural Services

Aside from PostgreSQL, you may be using modules or plugins that require some additional architectural setup. For example, if you’re using the [Redis Event Bus Module](../../../architectural-modules/event/redis/page.mdx), you must set up a Redis database and obtain a connection URL to it.

---

## Set Environment Variables

During or after the deployment process, set the following environment variables:

```bash
DATABASE_TYPE=postgres
DATABASE_URL=<YOUR_DB_URL>
JWT_SECRET=<RANDOM_SECRET>
COOKIE_SECRET=<RANDOM_SECRET>
NODE_ENV=production
NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false
```

Where:

- `<YOUR_DB_URL>` is the connection URL to the PostgreSQL database.
- `<RANDOM_SECRET>` is a random string that will be used to create authentication and cookie tokens. Make sure to set different ones for `JWT_SECRET` and `COOKIE_SECRET`.

Also, add any other environment variables relevant to your Medusa application. For example, if you’ve setup Redis, make sure to add an environment variable for the Redis connection URL.

---

## Test the Deployed Medusa Application

After you’ve deployed your Medusa application, you can test it out in different ways:

- Go to `{your_app_url}/health`, where `{your_app_url}` is the URL to your deployed Medusa application. If the deployment was successful, you should see `OK` printed in your browser.
- If you deployed the [Medusa Admin with the Medusa application](#deploying-with-the-medusa-application), go to `{your_app_url}/app` to view the admin dashboard. If you changed the value of the admin plugin’s `path` configuration, make sure to replace `app` with that instead.

---

## Set Up CORS Configuration

To connect your storefront and, if deployed separately, your admin dashboard to your deployed Medusa application, set up the [adminCors](/references/medusa-config#adminCors) and [storeCors](/references/medusa-config#storeCors) properties of the `http` configuration in `medusa-config.js`.

---

## Create Admin User

If your hosting provider gives you access to execute commands in your deployed Medusa application project, create a new admin user by running the following command in the root directory of your deployed Medusa application:

```bash
npx medusa user --email admin@medusa-test.com --password supersecret
```
