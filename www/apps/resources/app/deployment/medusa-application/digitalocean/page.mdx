<Note type="soon">

The following deployment guide doesn't support Medusa v2 yet.

</Note>

[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) is a reliable hosting provider that provides different ways to host websites and servers.

<Note type="check">

- Production Event Bus Module installed and configured in the Medusa application, such as the [Redis Event Bus Module](../../../architectural-modules/event/redis/page.mdx).
- Production Cache Module installed and configured in the Medusa application, such as the [Redis Cache Module](../../../architectural-modules/cache/redis/page.mdx).
- [DigitalOcean account](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/registrations/new).
- [GitHub repository with the Medusa application's code](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).

</Note>

## Configure the Admin

If you're using the Medusa Admin plugin, you have two options to deploy it: either with the Medusa application or separately.

### Deploying with the Medusa Application

To deploy the admin with the Medusa application:

1. Your chosen plan must offer at least 2GB of RAM.
2. Enable the autoRebuild option of the admin plugin:

```js title="medusa-config.js" highlights={[["7"]]}
const plugins = [
  // ...
  {
    resolve: "@medusajs/admin",
    /** @type {import('@medusajs/admin').PluginOptions} */
    options: {
      autoRebuild: true,
      // other options...
    },
  },
]
```

Alternatively, you can use a GitHub action to build the admin as explained [here](!docs!/deployment).

### Deploying Separately

To deploy the admin separately, disable the admin plugin's serve option:

```js title="medusa-config.js" highlights={[["10"]]}
const plugins = [
  // ...
  {
    resolve: "@medusajs/admin",
    /** @type {import('@medusajs/admin').PluginOptions} */
    options: {
      // only enable `serve` in development
      // you may need to add the NODE_ENV variable
      // manually
      serve: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development",
      // other options...
    },
  },
]
```

This ensures that the admin isn't built or served in production. You can also change `@medusajs/admin` dependency to be a dev dependency in `package.json`.

You can alternatively remove the admin plugin for the plugins array.

---

## Changes to package.json

Change the `start` script in `package.json` to the following:

```json
"start": "medusa migrations run && medusa start"
```

This ensures that migrations are run every time the Medusa application is restarted.

---

## Changes to medusa-config.js

In `medusa-config.js`, the `DATABASE_URL` variable is set to the environment variable `DATABASE_URL`. You have to change this as DigitalOcean provides the different details of the database connection separately.

Replace the previous declaration of `DATABASE_URL` in `medusa-config.js` with the following:

```js title="medusa-config.js"
const DB_USERNAME = process.env.DB_USERNAME
const DB_PASSWORD = process.env.DB_PASSWORD
const DB_HOST = process.env.DB_HOST
const DB_PORT = process.env.DB_PORT
const DB_DATABASE = process.env.DB_DATABASE

const DATABASE_URL = 
  `postgres://${DB_USERNAME}:${DB_PASSWORD}` + 
  `@${DB_HOST}:${DB_PORT}/${DB_DATABASE}`
```

In addition, add to the `projectConfig` property in the exported object a new property `database_extra`:

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = {
  projectConfig: {
    // ...
    database_extra: { ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false } },
  },
}
```

---

## Changes to .gitignore

Your `.gitignore` may have `yarn.lock` and `package-lock.json` in it. If so, remove both or one of them to ensure they're committed with your code. Otherwise, you may face build errors after deployment.

---

## Deploy to DigitalOcean App

After logging into your account, click on the Create button in the navigation bar and choose App Platform.

### Choose Repository

In the Create App page:

1. Choose GitHub from the Service Provider list.
2. If you haven’t given DigitalOcean access before to your GitHub account, click on Manage Access under Source Code. You’ll then be redirected to GitHub to give DigitalOcean access.
3. Once DigitalOcean has access to your GitHub account, you should see a Repository input. Click on it and search for the repository you created earlier.
4. Additional inputs will show up to choose the Branch, Source Directory, and Autodeploy options.
5. If you host your Medusa application in a monorepo, you should change the Source Directory to the directory the Medusa application. Otherwise, it can be left as is.

Once you’re done, click Next to move on to the next step.

### Specify Web Service Resources

Click on the Edit button next to the Web Service, and ensure the following information is set correctly:

- Resource Type is set to Node.js
- HTTP Port is set to 9000
- HTTP Request Routes is set to `/`

Once you've set up everything correctly, click the Back button at the end of the form.

### Specify Database Resources

On the same page:

1. Expand the Add Resources section, choose Database, then click Add.
2. In the new page, you’ll be shown a PostgreSQL database to be created. It’s important to choose a name that you’ll remember as you’ll need the name in next steps. You can leave the name as is if it’s not necessary to change it.
3. Once you’re done, click Create and Attach. You’ll be redirected back to the previous page with the database added to the resources.

Once you’re done, click Next to move on to the next step.

### Set Environment Variables

Click Edit on the second row to add environment variables specific to the Web Service. Add the following environment variables:

```bash
DB_USERNAME=${db.USERNAME}
DB_PASSWORD=${db.PASSWORD}
DB_HOST=${db.HOSTNAME}
DB_PORT=${db.PORT}
DB_DATABASE=${db.DATABASE}
REDIS_URL=${redis.DATABASE_URL}
JWT_SECRET=secret
COOKIE_SECRET=secret
NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false
YARN_PRODUCTION=false
NODE_ENV=production
```

Notice how for database environment variables you access the values from the database you created earlier `db`. If you changed the name of the database, you must change `db` here to the name you supplied to the PostgreSQL database.

Another thing to note here is that you added a `REDIS_URL` environment variable that uses a `redis` resource to retrieve the URL. Redis is necessary if you're using Scheduled Jobs and if you're using Redis modules, such as the Redis Event Bus module. You’ll be creating the Redis resource in a later section.

If you're using modules that require setting other environment variables, make sure to set them here. You can also add them later.

<Note type="warning">

It’s highly recommended to use strong, randomly generated secrets for `JWT_SECRET` and `COOKIE_SECRET`.

</Note>

Once you’re done click Save, then click Next to proceed to the next section.

### Finalize App

In the next section, you’ll be shown the app info and the region it will be deployed to. You can leave it all as is or make changes if you find it necessary.

Once you’re done, click Next to go to the next step.

In the final step, you can see a review of everything you created. If everything looks good, scroll down and click Create Resource.

### Create Redis Resource

While the Medusa application is being deployed, you can create the Redis resource. To do that:

1. Click the Create button at the top right and choose Databases from the dropdown.
2. In the new page under Choose a database engine, choose Redis.
3. Scroll down to the “Choose a unique database cluster name” input. Since you used the name `redis` in the `REDIS_URL` environment variables, change the value to `redis` here.
4. Once you’re done, click on Create Database Cluster.

### Attach Redis Database

Once the Redis database is created, you need to attach it to your app. To do that:

1. Go back to the App you created earlier by choose App Platform in the sidebar then clicking on the App's name.
2. Click the white Create button at the top right and choose Create/Attach Database.
3. In the new page, click on the Previously Created DigitalOcean Database radio button. Then, under Database Cluster select the Redis database you just created.
4. Once you’re done click Attach Database. This adds the Redis database to the list of resources of your App and will trigger a redeployment of the App.

### Change Health Check Settings

By default, DigitalOcean performs a health check immediately as the app runs. However, the Medusa application requires some initial load-time before it's ready for a health check.

So, you must delay the app's health check to enure that the deployment doesn't fail. To do that:

1. On your App's page, click on Settings.
2. From the tabs before the settings section, choose the name of your web service resource.
3. Scroll down and find the "Health Checks" section, then click on "Edit" next to it.
4. In the section that opens, expand the "Show Advanced Parameters" section.
5. Find the "Initial Delay (s)" input and set its value to `300`.
6. Once done, click on the Save button.

This redeploys your app, which should finish successfully.

## Test your Deployed Medusa Application

Once the redeployment is complete, copy the URL of the App which can be found under the App’s name.

Then, go to `{your_app_url}/store/products` which returns the products in your store.

### Health Route

You can access `/health` to get health status of your deployed Medusa application.

### Testing the Medusa Admin

If you deployed the [Medusa Admin with the Medusa application](#deploying-with-the-medusa-application), you can test it by opening `{your_app_url}/app`. If you changed the admin path, make sure to change `/app` to the path you've set.

---

## Troubleshooting

If errors occur in your deployment, find the logs by going to the Activity tab in your App.

### ERROR: Failed to build / Project does not contain a package manager

If you find this error in your logs, make sure to remove `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json` from the `.gitignore` file in your project, then commit the changes.

---

## Run Commands on Your Medusa Application

To run commands on your Medusa application, access the console on the App’s page by choosing the Console tab. This opens a console in your browser where you can run commands on your Medusa application.

### Create Admin User

For example, run the following command to create a new admin user:

```bash
npx medusa user --email <EMAIL> --password <PASSWORD>
```

Make sure to replace `<EMAIL>` and `<PASSWORD>` with the credentials you want to give the user.

---

## Add Environment Variables

You’ll likely need to add environment variables later such as Admin Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and Store CORS variables.

Refer to [DigitalOcean's documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/how-to/use-environment-variables) on how to add environment variables to your App.
