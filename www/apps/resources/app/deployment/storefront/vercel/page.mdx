The following deployment guide doesn't support Medusa v2 yet.

This guide explains how to deploy the Medusa Admin separately from the Medusa application to Vercel.

<Note title="Important">

Per Vercel’s [license and plans](https://vercel.com/pricing), their free plan can only be used for personal, non-commercial projects. So, you can deploy the Next.js Starter on the free plan for development purposes, but for commercial projects, you must update your Vercel plan.

</Note>

[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions. It provides developers with a platform to deploy web projects quickly and easily.

## Deploy to Vercel

This section covers how to deploy the storefront, either using the Vercel website or using Vercel’s CLI tool.

### Option 1: Using the Vercel Website

This section explains how to deploy the storefront using the Vercel website:

1. Open the [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard) after logging in.
2. Click on the “Add New…” button next to the search bar.
3. Choose Project from the dropdown.
4. In the new page that opens, find the Git repository that holds your Next.js Starter Template and click on the Import button. If you haven’t connected your Vercel account to any Git provider, you must do that first.
5. In the Configure Project form:
    1. Open the Environment Variables collapsible, and add the following environment variables:
        - `NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL`: the URL to your deployed Medusa application.
        - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`: The URL of your storefront. If you don't have a domain ready yet, you can add it later. However, you may face some errors in your storefront.
        - `REVALIDATE_SECRET`: A secret used for revalidating data. Learn more in the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#on-demand-revalidation).
    2. You can optionally edit the Project Name.
6. Once you’re done, click on the “Deploy” button.

This will start the deployment of the storefront. Once it’s done, you’ll be redirected to the main dashboard of your new project.

<Note>

At this point, when you visit the storefront, you'll face errors related to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). Before you start using the storefront, follow along the [Configure CORS on the storefront](#configure-cors-on-the-medusa-application) section.

</Note>

### Option 2: Using Vercel’s CLI Tool

This section explains how to deploy the storefront using the Vercel CLI tool. You should have the CLI tool installed first, as explained in [Vercel’s documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/cli).

In the directory holding your storefront, run the following command to deploy your storefront:

```bash
vercel --build-env NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL=<YOUR_APP_URL>
vercel --build-env NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=<YOUR_BASE_URL>
vercel --build-env REVALIDATE_SECRET=<YOUR_REVALIDATION_SECRET>
```

Where:

- `<YOUR_APP_URL>`: the URL of your deployed Medusa application.
- `<YOUR_BASE_URL>`: The URL of your storefront. If you don't have a domain ready yet, you can add it later. However, you may face some errors in your storefront.
- `<YOUR_REVALIDATION_SECRET>`: A secret used for revalidating data. Learn more in the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#on-demand-revalidation).

You’ll then be asked to log in if you haven’t already, and to choose the scope to deploy your project to. You can also decide to link the storefront to an existing project, or change the project’s name.

When asked `In which directory is your code located?`, keep the default `./` and just press Enter.

The project setup will then start. When asked if you want to modify the settings, answer `N` to keep the default settings.

It'll take a couple of minutes for the deployment to finish. The link to the storefront will be shown in the final output of the command.

<Note>

At this point, when you visit the storefront, you'll face errors related to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). Before you start using the storefront, follow along the [Configure CORS on the storefront](#configure-cors-on-the-medusa-application) section.

</Note>

## Configure CORS on the Medusa application

To send requests to the Medusa application from the Next.js Starter, set the `STORE_CORS` environment variable on your Medusa application to the deployed storefront's URL.

On your Medusa application, add the following environment variable:

```bash
STORE_CORS=<STOREFRONT_URL>
```

Where `<STOREFRONT_URL>` is the URL of your storefront.

Then, restart your Medusa application. Once the application is running again, you can use your storefront.
