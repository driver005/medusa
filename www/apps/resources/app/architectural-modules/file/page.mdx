## What is a File Provider Module?

A file provider module implements the logic of handling uploads and downloads. The File Module must have one file provider module configured.

By default, Medusa uses the Local File Module. This module uploads files to the `uploads` directory of your Medusa application.

This is useful for development. However, for production, itâ€™s highly recommended to use other File Modules, such as the S3 Module.
