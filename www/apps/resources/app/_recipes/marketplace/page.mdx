In this recipe, you'll find resources to guide you in building a marketplace with Medusa.

## Overview

A marketplace is an online commerce store that allows different vendors to sell their products within the same commerce system. Customers can purchase products from any of these vendors, and vendors can manage their orders separately.

## Associate Data Models with Stores

By default, data models like users, products, or orders aren't associated with a store, as it's assumed there's one store in Medusa. For a marketplace, each of these data models should be associated with their respective stores.

To associate these data models with the `Store` data model, extend and customize data models created in the Medusa core package `@medusajs/medusa`, such as the `User` data model, to add a relation to the `Store` data model.

<Card
  href="#"
  title="Extend a Data Model"
  text="Learn how to extend a data model in Medusa."
  startIcon={<AcademicCapSolid />}
  showLinkIcon={false}
/>

<Details summaryContent="Example: Associate User with Store">

  For example, to associate the `User` data model with the `Store` data model, create the file `src/models/user.ts` with the following content:

  ```ts title="src/models/user.ts"
  import { 
    Column,
    Entity,
    Index,
    JoinColumn,
    ManyToOne,
  } from "typeorm"
  import {
    User as MedusaUser,
  } from "@medusajs/medusa"
  import { Store } from "./store"

  @Entity()
  export class User extends MedusaUser {
    @Index("UserStoreId")
    @Column({ nullable: true })
    store_id?: string

    @ManyToOne(() => Store, (store) => store.members)
    @JoinColumn({ name: "store_id", referencedColumnName: "id" })
    store?: Store
  }
  ```

  Then, you need to extend the `UserRepository` to point to your extended data model. To do that, create the file `src/repositories/user.ts` with the following content:

  ```ts title="src/repositories/user.ts"
  import { User } from "../models/user"
  import { 
    dataSource,
  } from "@medusajs/medusa/dist/loaders/database"
  import {
    UserRepository as MedusaUserRepository,
  } from "@medusajs/medusa/dist/repositories/user"

  export const UserRepository = dataSource
    .getRepository(User)
    .extend({
      ...Object.assign(
        MedusaUserRepository, 
        { target: User }
      ),
    })

  export default UserRepository
  ```

  Next, you need to create a migration that reflects the changes on the `User` data model in your database. To do that, run the following command to create a migration file:

  ```bash
  npx typeorm migration:create src/migrations/add-user-store-id
  ```

  This creates a file in the `src/migrations` directory of the format `<TIMESTAMP>_add-user-store-id.ts`. Replace the `up` and `down` methods in that file with the methods here:

  ```ts title="src/migrations/<TIMESTAMP>_add-user-store-id.ts"
  // ...

  export class AddUserStoreId1681287255173 
    implements MigrationInterface {
      // ...

      public async up(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
          await queryRunner.query(
            `ALTER TABLE "user" ADD "store_id" character varying`
          )
          await queryRunner.query(
            `CREATE INDEX "UserStoreId" ON "user" ("store_id")`
          )
      }

      public async down(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
          await queryRunner.query(
            `DROP INDEX "public"."UserStoreId"`
          )
          await queryRunner.query(
            `ALTER TABLE "user" DROP COLUMN "store_id"`
          )
      }

  }
  ```

  Finally, to reflect these changes and start using them, `build` your changes and run migrations with the following commands:

  ```bash npm2yarn
  npm run build
  npx medusa migrations run
  ```

  You can extend other data models in a similar manner to associate them with a store.

## Access Logged-in User

Throughout your development, you'll likely need access to the logged-in user. For example, you add a new product to the logged-in admin user's store.

  text="Learn how to access the logged-in user throughout your project using a Middleware."

## Customize Data Management Functionalities

After associating data models with stores, customize how certain data management functionalities are implemented in the Medusa core package.

For example, when a new user is created, you ensure that it's associated either with a new store or with the store of the logged-in user. Another example is associating a new product with the logged-in user's store.

To customize these functionalities, extend services.

<Card
  href="#"
  title="Extend a Service"
  text="Learn how to extend a service in Medusa."
  startIcon={<AcademicCapSolid />}
  showLinkIcon={false}
/>

<Details summaryContent="Example: Extend User Service">

  You can extend the user service to change how the `create` method is implemented.

  To extend the user service, create the file `src/services/user.ts` with the following content:

  ```ts title="src/services/user.ts"
  import { Lifetime } from "awilix"
  import { 
    UserService as MedusaUserService,
  } from "@medusajs/medusa"
  import { User } from "../models/user"
  import { 
    CreateUserInput as MedusaCreateUserInput,
  } from "@medusajs/medusa/dist/types/user"
  import StoreRepository from "../repositories/store"

  type CreateUserInput = {
    store_id?: string
  } & MedusaCreateUserInput

  class UserService extends MedusaUserService {
    static LIFE_TIME = Lifetime.SCOPED
    protected readonly loggedInUser_: User | null
    protected readonly storeRepository_: typeof StoreRepository

    constructor(container, options) {
      super(...arguments)
      this.storeRepository_ = container.storeRepository

      try {
        this.loggedInUser_ = container.loggedInUser
      } catch (e) {
        // avoid errors when backend first runs
      }
    }

    async create(
      user: CreateUserInput,
      password: string
    ): Promise<User> {
      if (!user.store_id) {
        const storeRepo = this.manager_.withRepository(
          this.storeRepository_
        )
        let newStore = storeRepo.create()
        newStore = await storeRepo.save(newStore)
        user.store_id = newStore.id
      }

      return await super.create(user, password)
    }
  }

  export default UserService
  ```

  In the `create` method of this extended service, you create a new store if the user being created doesn't have a store associated with it.

  You can then test out your customization by running the `build` command and starting the Medusa application:

  ```bash npm2yarn
  npm run build
  npx medusa develop
  ```

## Listening to Events

While implementing your marketplace, you'll need to listen to certain events then perform actions asynchronously. For example, you listen to the `order.placed` event and, when triggered, create child orders of the order, separating ordered items by their associated store.

To listen to events, create Subscribers that subscribe a handler function to an event. In that handler function, implement the desired functionality.

<Card
  href="#"
  title="Create a Subscriber"
  text="Learn how to create a subscriber in Medusa."
  startIcon={<AcademicCapSolid />}
  showLinkIcon={false}
/>

<Details summaryContent="Example: Listen to Order Created Event">

  To listen to the `order.placed` event, create the file `src/subscribers/orderNotifier.ts` with the following content:

  ```ts title="src/subscribers/orderNotifier.ts"
  import { 
    type SubscriberConfig, 
    type SubscriberArgs,
    OrderService,
  } from "@medusajs/medusa"

  export default async function handleOrderPlaced({ 
    data, eventName, container, pluginOptions, 
  }: SubscriberArgs<Record<string, string>>) {
    // TODO perform functionality
  }

  export const config: SubscriberConfig = {
    event: OrderService.Events.PLACED,
    context: {
      subscriberId: "order-placed-handler",
    },
  }
  ```

  This subscribes the `handleOrder` method to be executed whenever the `order.placed` event is emitted.

  You can then test out your subscriber by running the `build` command and starting the Medusa application:

  ```bash npm2yarn
  npm run build
  npx medusa develop
  ```

## Add Payment and Fulfillment Providers

Payment and fulfillment providers can be added through plugins or directly in your project. You can either create your own provider, use one of Medusa's official plugins, or use community plugins.

<Note>

Payment and fulfillment providers are associated with regions, which are not associated with a store, by default. To allow each store to specify its own payment and fulfillment providers, [associate the region with a store](#associate-data-models-with-stores).

</Note>

### Option 1: Create your own providers

<CardList itemsPerRow={2} items={[
  {
    href: "#",
    title: "Create a Payment Processor",
    text: "Learn how to create a payment processor.",
    startIcon: <AcademicCapSolid />,
    showLinkIcon: false
  },
  {
    href: "#",
    title: "Create a Fulfillment Provider",
    text: "Learn how to create a fulfillment provider.",
    startIcon: <AcademicCapSolid />,
    showLinkIcon: false
  }
]} />

### Option 2: Install a Plugin

<CardList itemsPerRow={2} items={[
  {
    href: "#",
    title: "Install an Official Medusa Plugin",
    text: "Check out available Medusa plugins to install.",
    startIcon: <AcademicCapSolid />,
    showLinkIcon: false
  },
  {
    href: "https://medusajs.com/plugins/",
    title: "Install a Community Plugin",
    text: "Check out available community plugins to install.",
    startIcon: <AcademicCapSolid />,
    showLinkIcon: false
  }
]} />

## Customize Admin

You can customize the admin to provide an interface to manage your custom features.

You can extend the Medusa Admin plugin to add widgets to existing pages, add new pages, or add setting pages.

<CardList items={[
  {
    href: "#",
    title: "Admin Widget",
    text: "Learn how to add widgets into existing admin pages.",
    startIcon: <AcademicCapSolid />,
    showLinkIcon: false
  },
  {
    href: "#",
    title: "Admin UI Routes",
    text: "Learn how to add new pages to your Medusa Admin.",
    startIcon: <AcademicCapSolid />,
    showLinkIcon: false
  },
  {
    href: "#",
    title: "Admin Setting Page",
    text: "Learn how to add new page to the Medusa Admin settings.",
    startIcon: <AcademicCapSolid />,
    showLinkIcon: false
  }
]} />

## Implement Role-Based Access Control

In your marketplace, you may need to implement role-based access control (RBAC) within stores. This restricts some users' permissions to specified functionalities or API Routes.

To implement this functionality, follow the RBAC recipe.

## Build a Storefront

Medusa provides a Next.js Starter. Since you've customized your Medusa project, you must either customize the existing Next.js Starter, or create a custom storefront.

<CardList itemsPerRow={2} items={[
  {
    href: "#",
    title: "Option 1: Next.js Starter",
    text: "Install the Next.js Starter to customize it.",
    startIcon: <AcademicCapSolid />,
    showLinkIcon: false
  },
