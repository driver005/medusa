In this recipe, you'll find resources to guide you in building an omnichannel commerce with Medusa.

## Overview

Merchants selling across different channels need an efficient way to manage their commerce data and operations across these channels. Omnichannel commerce solves this problem by allowing merchants to support multiple channels through a single system while maintaining layers of separation.

Omnichannel commerce also provides customers a seamless shopping experience, regardless of where they’re shopping. Whether they’re buying your products from your online store, a marketplace like Amazon, or through social media, you provide them with a good experience and handle orders consistently.

Medusa’s modular architecture facilitates building omnichannel commerce, as your server and storefront aren’t tightly coupled. You can also use the Sales Channel Module's features to expand your business into other avenues like marketplaces and social commerce.

## Create Multiple Storefronts with One Server

when creating an omnichannel commerce, you build multiple webshops or mobile apps. All these storefronts should provide your customers with a similar experience, allow them to browse products, and place orders.

Medusa's commerce features are available as REST APIs that storefronts can access to provide these features for customers. This separation also gives you freedom in choosing the tech stack of the storefronts you’re creating.

## Integrate with Marketplaces and Social Commerce

Businesses are no longer bound to sell in their stores. They can reach their customers through their different shopping channels.

One example is marketplaces like Amazon. Customers searching through Amazon to find products are inadvertently searching through many third-party stores connected to Amazon’s marketplace.

You can implement this example in Medusa with the Sales Channel Module and a custom plugin. Use the Sales Channel Module's features to set different product availability across sales channels. Then, in the custom plugin, integrate with Amazon’s seller program and use their APIs to push your products on Amazon.

Another channel that attracts customer sales is social media. You can create a plugin that integrates with social media apps to show your products and sell them to customers.

## Optimize Customer Experience

With Medusa’s modular architecture, businesses focus on bringing their brands to life without restrictions.

Implement the customer journey and design for your storefronts that leads to the best customer experience. The Medusa application doesn't impose any restrictions on how the frontend is built.

Medusa’s architecture also makes it easier to integrate any third-party services necessary to provide a better customer experience with a plugin. Storefronts then use the features provided by that plugin if they're exposed by API routes.

For example, if you integrate a search plugin like Algolia in the Medusa application, the storefronts use it through the [Search Products API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#products_postproductssearch). Another example is installing the Stripe payment plugin in the Medusa application and using it in your storefronts to make payments before placing an order.
