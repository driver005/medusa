In this recipe, you'll find resources to guide you in building a multi-region store with Medusa.

## Overview

A multi-regional store allows merchants to sell across different countries. This includes supporting each country's tax rules, currency, available shipping and payment options, and more.

Medusa comes with multi-regional support out of the box. This recipe explains how to benefit from Medusa's features to create a multi-regional store.

## Multi-Region Setup

With Medusa, you can create unlimited regions in your store. Each region has configurations managed through the Medusa Admin Dashboard or the Admin API.

### Currency

Merchants specify the currency of each region. Multiple regions can have the same currency, but a region has only one currency.

When customers view your products from a region, they see the prices in the region’s currency. As explained later, this also affects which prices are shown to the customer in a region.

### Tax rates and providers

At the regional level, merchants define a default tax rate and tax rates for specific conditions (for example, for a particular set of products). Each region also has a different tax provider that calculates the taxes. You can use Medusa's default tax provider or create a custom tax provider.

During checkout, the taxes are calculated based on the customer's region, tax configurations, and rates.

    startIcon: <AcademicCapSolid />,
    showLinkIcon: false
  },
]} />

### Payment and Fulfillment Providers

Merchants choose which payment and fulfillment providers are available in each region. For example, one region can use Payment Provider A and B while another only uses Payment Provider B.

During checkout, customers only see the payment providers and shipping options configured for the region. This lets you give customers a localized experience that feels familiar and instills trust.

Medusa provides official plugins for payment and fulfillment providers. You can also create custom providers.

## Prices Per Region and Currency

When a merchant sets the price of a product in Medusa, they specify the price per currency and region. Merchants also benefit from this pricing mechanism when adding sales or overriding prices for specific conditions using the Pricing Module's features.

Then, customers see the price of a product based on the region they're in, the region's currency, and whether any special pricing applies to their case. Medusa has a pricing strategy to show the customer the best price based on their context.

Using the tax-inclusive feature, merchants specify prices including taxes per currency and region. Medusa then calculates the tax amount applied to a line item in the cart based on the region's tax configurations.

<CardList itemsPerRow={2} items={[
  {
    href: "#",
    title: "Setting Product Prices in Medusa Admin",
    text: "Learn how to set a product prices in Medusa Admin.",
    startIcon: <UsersSolid />,
    showLinkIcon: false
  },
  {
    href: "#",
    title: "Display Product Price in Storefront",
    text: "Learn how to display the correct product price in a storefront.",
    startIcon: <AcademicCapSolid />,
    showLinkIcon: false
  },
]} />

## Multi-Warehouse Support

Medusa's Inventory and Stock Location Modules provide multi-warehouse features that allow you to manage inventory across different locations. Merchants then control which location an item in an order is fulfilled, allowing them to keep a correct inventory count across locations and sales channels.

A multi-regional setup lets you manage your inventory through Medusa across the different regions you serve. Your products’ inventory and availability aren't bound to a single stock location, and customers are always shown accurate inventory information based on the location associated with their sales channel.

  {
    href: "#",
    title: "Multi-warehouse Overview",
    text: "Learn about the Multi-warehouse feature in Medusa.",
    startIcon: <AcademicCapSolid />,

  {

    title: "Manage Stock Locations",
    text: "Learn how to manage stock locations in the Medusa Admin.",

    text: "Learn how to manage inventory in the Medusa Admin.",
    startIcon: <AcademicCapSolid />,
    showLinkIcon: false
  },

## Multi-Lingual Setup

By integrating a third-party Content Management Systems (CMS), you benefit from rich content features including managing your content in multiple languages. This allows you to cater to customers’ different languages in the regions you serve.

Medusa provides an official Contentful plugin and a community Strapi plugin. You can also create a CMS plugin that integrates with your preferred CMS platform to provide multi-lingual features.

<CardList itemsPerRow={2} items={[
  {
    href: "#",
    title: "CMS Plugins",
    text: "Learn about available CMS plugins.",
    startIcon: <AcademicCapSolid />,
    showLinkIcon: false
  },
  {
    href: "#",
    title: "How to Create a Plugin",
    text: "Learn how to create a plugin.",
    startIcon: <AcademicCapSolid />,
    showLinkIcon: false
  },
]} />

## Automatic Location Detection

When you sell across regions, it's essential to detect the customer's region and provide them with the products, prices, and content relevant to them without requiring actions from their side.

Medusa provides an IP Lookup plugin that lets you detect a customer's location and region using [ipstack](https://ipstack.com/). You can also create a plugin that detects the location through a different logic.

<CardList itemsPerRow={2} items={[
  {
    href: "#",
    title: "IP Lookup Plugin",
    text: "Install the IP Lookup plugin.",
    startIcon: <AcademicCapSolid />,
    showLinkIcon: false
  },
  {
    href: "#",
    title: "How to Create a Plugin",
    text: "Learn how to create a plugin.",
    startIcon: <AcademicCapSolid />,
    showLinkIcon: false
  },
]} />
