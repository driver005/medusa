In this recipe, you'll learn how to build an ecommerce store and start selling with Medusa.

## Overview

Businesses use an ecommerce store to allow customers to browse their products and make purchases. It also includes accepting payments, managing orders, and more.

Medusa provides all essential commerce features out-of-the-box. Businesses can go live and start selling without making any adjustments. They can also power-up their store with plugins for payment, fulfillment, and more.

## Create a Next.js Starter Storefront

The Medusa application can be used with any storefront. All you have to do is connect to its Store APIs to use the application's commerce features.

You can install, use, and customize the Next.js Starter storefront to benefit from all the necessary ecommerce features. Alternatively, you can build your own storefront.

## (Optional) Install Plugins

Medusa provides official plugins for payment, fulfillment, search, and more. These plugins provide new functionalities for both your Medusa application and your storefront.

For example, to accept payment with Stripe, install the Stripe plugin.
