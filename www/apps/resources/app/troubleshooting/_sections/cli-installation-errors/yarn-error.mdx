If you install the Medusa CLI tool with Yarn, then try to use the CLI tool but get the error:

```bash noReport
command not found: medusa
```

You have to add Yarn’s install location to the PATH variable:

<LegacyCodeTabs
  tabs={[
    {
      label: "MacOS / Linux",
      value: "unix",
      code: {
        lang: "bash",
        source: `export PATH="$(yarn global bin):$PATH"`
      }
    },
    {
      label: "Windows",
      value: "windows",
      code: {
        lang: "bash",
        source: `# MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE %path%
    setx path "%path%;c:\\users\\YOURUSERNAME\\appdata\\local\\yarnbin"
    # YOURUSERNAME is your account username`
      }
    }
  ]}
  group="operating-systems"
/>
